Be<font color='grey'>a</font>utiful is better than ugly.<br/>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br/>
Simple is better than complex.<br/>
Complex i<font color='grey'>s</font> better than complicated.<br/>
Flat is better than nested.<br/>
Sparse is better than dense.<br/>
Readability counts.<br/>
Special cases aren't spe<font color='grey'>c</font>ial enough to break the rules.<br/>
Although practicality beats purity.<br/>
Errors should never pass silently.<br/>
Unless expl<font color='grey'>i</font>citly silenced.<br/>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br/>
There should be one-and preferably only one-obvious way to do it.<br/>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br/>
Now is better than never.<br/>
Although never is often better than r<font color='grey'>i</font>ght now.<br/>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br/>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br/>
Namespaces are one honking great idea-let's do more of those!<br/>
